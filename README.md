This is an attempt at developing the model of a basic music player, with the help of HTML, CSS & Javascript, over the course of a few weeks, with help from a few external sources.
This player can, with the help of JS, be able to play the songs encrypted in the code. There are also play button (to play/pause the songs), as well as forward and backward buttons, created with the help of FontAwesome icons.
